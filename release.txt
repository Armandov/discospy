Release workflow steps:

- bump.sh (increments versions and creates git tag)
- git push --tags (release workflow is triggered)
- fill in release notes into auto-generated github release
- release.sh (builds package and uploads to Test-PyPI)

Troubleshooting:

- retag.sh
  1) Deletes local and remote git tags
  2) Makes sure local commits are pushed to remote
  3) Creates tags and pushes tags again)

Release notes are not automatically deleted on retag.sh usage. This for a
reason: They might be copied over to a fixed release and shouldn't be lost.

Optionally retag.sh accepts a second cli arg allowing to pass --options to the
push in step 2 (e.g. --force-with-lease, use with caution)
